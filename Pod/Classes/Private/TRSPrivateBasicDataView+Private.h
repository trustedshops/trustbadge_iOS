/**
 This is a private header to keep the public interface clean from these internal helper methods.
 It is part of the abstract TRSPrivateBasicDataView class, however, and all classes inheriting from that
 should import this header along with the public one in their .m file.
 
 How the class importing this private interface is supposed to be used:
 It serves as a base class for any views accessing the Trsuted Shops backend. It can't work on its own, since
 there is no general view data in the backend. Different views should use different categories of TRSNetworkAgent
 to obtain their relevant data, but the general loading mechanism and template methods for layout and data
 preparation are provided by this class.
 
 These methods are to be overridden by subclasses (except 5, which you can override, but don't have to):
 
 1: (void)finishInit;
 2: (BOOL)setupData:(id)data;
 3: (void)finishLoading;
 4: (void)performNetworkRequestWithSuccessBlock:(void (^)(id result))successBlock failureBlock:(void(^)(NSError *error))failureBlock;
 5: (NSString *)logStringForErrorCode:
 
 1) should be used to set up any basic proprties of the view. It is called during the designated initializers (so you should
 NOT call it yourself in the subclass).
 
 2) is called in the successBlock parameter that is given to performNetworkRequestWithSuccessBlock:failureBlock: (see 4)).
 Here you can save any data in properties in your view. The passed object is the same that the TRSNetworkAgent category
 method you set up returns, e.g. an NSDictionary for getProductGradeForTrustedShopsID:apiToken:SKU:success:failure:
 If for some reason the data turns out to be unusable, return NO. The superclass will then invoke the failure block
 argument that was passed to it in loadViewDataFromBackendWithSuccessBlock:failureBlock: with an appropriate error.
 
 3) is called right before the success block given to loadViewDataFromBackendWithSuccessBlock:failureBlock: is called.
 Here you should build the view hierarchy with the data that was just obtained from the backend (and stored
 somewhere by 2)). Note that the success block is called in any case after this method returns control flow
 to the superclass
 
 4) is not to be confused with loadViewDataFromBackendWithSuccessBlock:failureBlock: !
 Here you should invoke whatever category method of TRSNetworkAgent is responsbile for fetching the data your view subclass
 needs! On success respectively error you MUST invoke the corresponding block that is passed to this method! (Most likely
 you can just pass the blocks to your category method, if that has corresponding parameters.)
 
 5) doesn't need to be overridden, but you probably should do that if you must handle errors besides the common
 ones (like TSID not found and such). If you do that, call super first, and if that returns nil, try
 to create a log message suitable for your error. If you don't know the error either, return nil for a standard
 "unknown error" to be logged. (note that this is just useful for logging, the actual error handlers still
 propagate the error to the relevant failure blocks).
 
 NONE of those methods are to be called by yourself, this is done by the public base implementation in TRSPrivateBasicDataView.
 
 With them properly overridden, any subclass view will work like the following:
 Regardless how it is initialized, finishInit takes care of how it looks right after initialization and before
 data is loaded (note that also initWithCoder calls this before all properties are decoded).
 After init, the view can be loaded with loadViewDataFromBackendWithSuccessBlock:failureBlock:. The method prepares
 the TRSNetworkAgent as far as it can and then relies on your implementation of performNetworkRequestWithSuccessBlock:failureBlock:
 to actually make the agent get data. You don't need to worry about handling common errors or callbacks.
 On success, it calls first setupData: and then finishLoading, so your implementation of these defines how the view
 is built up internally. From then on it acts exactly like any UIView, i.e. you need to override e.g. layoutSubviews
 accordingly to adapt to UI changes etc.
 
 Due to this design, you MUST NOT override loadViewDataFromBackendWithSuccessBlock:failureBlock: and you MUST
 override performNetworkRequestWithSuccessBlock:failureBlock: as is explained under 4)
 
 Furthermore, you should not expose the methods from the private protocol to public views.

 This method _can_ be overridden, but if you do so, you should call super first. It returns a string that

 TRSErrorDomainTSIDNotFound, TRSErrorDomainInvalidData, and TRSErrorDomainMissingTSIDOrAPIToken. For any other
 error, this method returns nil in this default implementation. If, however, the domain is TRSErrorDomain AND
 the error not one of the above, the view will log "[trustbadge] An unkown error occured." to the console, so
 you should override it to add any additional error code log messages relevant to your view (e.g. missing SKU).
