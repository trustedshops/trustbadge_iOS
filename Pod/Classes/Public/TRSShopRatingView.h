/**
 A constant specifying the minimum height of the view.
 This indirectly also influences the view's width, although the latter also depends on the label displayed under the
 stars once the view is loaded. If the text in the label is short (depends on the number of reviews and localization), 
 then the width of the view is 2.5 times its height. If it has longer text, the width is higher.
 This means that the absolute minimum width the view can have is `kTRSShopGradingViewMinHeight * 2.5`.

/**
 `TRSShopRatingView` is a view designed to show a shop's rating.
 
 It consists of a row of five stars at the top and a detail label on the bottom. Tha latter has the form
 "xx.xx/5.00 (x.xxx Reviews)", i.e. it shows the numerical grade and number of reviews it is based on in brackets.
 The text "Reviews" is localized to your app's language settings and correctly adapts for singular if there is 
 only one review (which we hope your shop will exceed quickly).
 Font colors are fixed at the moment to black (primary) and dark grey (for the 5.00).
 Like the `TRSTrustbadgeView` this view must be loaded from the Trusted Shops backend to display anything meaningful.
 Otherwise it is just empty. Because of this you might want to add the view programmatically to a given hierarchy only
 when the load succeeds. See `loadShopRatingWithSuccessBlock:failureBlock:` for details.
 
 If the user taps on a successfully loaded `TRSShopRatingView` a link to the shop's certificate is opened in Safari.
 Unloaded views simply do nothing on tap.

 The alignment for the view's contents.
 
 Although it is of type `NSTextAlignment` this value also affects the row of stars at the view's top.
 It is `NSTextAlignmentNatural` by default, which has the view rely on your `UIView`'s 
 `userInterfaceLayoutDirectionForSemanticContentAttribute:` and the view's `semanticContentAttribute` property.
 This will make the view automatically switch from left aligned to right aligned in a reight-to-left
 environment. If such behavior is unwanted, simply set the property to a fixed value of
 `NSTextAlignmentLeft`, `NSTextAlignmentRight`, or `NSTextAlignmentCenter` (same as `NSTextAlignmentJustified`).

 on PROD and you can't mess up anything by simply displaying a certificate anyways. Just don't be confused it the
 grade displayed on PROD differs from what a view shows when `debugMode` is set to `YES`.)
